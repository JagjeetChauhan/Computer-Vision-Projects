## Projects 📂

### 1. Human vs Horse Classifier 🐴👤
**Description**:  
This project is a deep learning model designed to differentiate between humans and horses in images. The classifier is trained on a dataset of **1,000 images** (500 images of humans and 500 images of horses). It leverages the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to achieve accurate image classification.  

**Highlights**:  
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset containing 1,000 labeled images.  
- **Model Architecture**: Built with a CNN architecture designed for binary classification.  
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras used for model training and evaluation.  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved promising accuracy on both training and validation datasets.
